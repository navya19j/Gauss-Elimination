# Gauss Elimination
 Gauss Elimination with Partial Pivoting and Gauss Jordan ELimination

<b>Gauss Elimination With Partial Pivoting</b>-

Write a general program for Gauss elimination with
partial pivoting.
(b) With the program created, solve the following set of
equations.

− 3y + 7z = 2

 x + 2y − z = 3

 5x − 2y = 2
 
Input file (input1.txt) is given for the above set of equations.
The program needs to read from the input file and then write 2
the calculated values of x, y,z in a text file (file name –
output1.txt) with each xi value in a separate line of text file

<b> Gauss Jordon Elimination</b>- 

(a)Write a general program and solve the following matrix
equations with the help of Gauss Jordon technique:

[𝟏 –𝟏 𝟐][x] = [-8]

[𝟏 𝟏 𝟏  ][y] = [-2]

[𝟐 − 𝟐 𝟑][z] = [-20]

(b) Evaluate Inverse of Matrix.
